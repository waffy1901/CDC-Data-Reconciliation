# CDC-Data-Reconciliation

## Technologies used:

*Python, FastAPI, React*

For our backend selection, we have chosen to use a Python framework called FastAPI useful for integrating RESTful APIs. We chose this backend because it is easy to use, creates automatic documentation, and will be able to run on basically any hardware that the state would like to use. Next, we chose to use React to create our user interface as it makes it easy to create a stateful UI and the component style makes it easy to reuse existing code. Notably, the client for this project requested that we use Python and RESTful APIs for our backend logic. The reasons for this are that these technologies are proven as well as familiar with existing employees.

## Rationale for coded portion:

*Coded portion: As a data scientist, I want to generate reports detailing differences between state and CDC case data so that I can remedy the discrepancies.*

We chose to implement this section of the program because it is the single most important and basic part of the application. Users need to be able to generate reports indicating the differences between two csv files in order for any other part of the program to be useful.
